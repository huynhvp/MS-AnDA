# DESCRIPTION
MS-AnDA is a Python library for Multi-scale Analog Data Assimilation, applications to ocean remote sensing. We presented a novel data-driven model for the spatio-temporal interpolation of satellite-derived SST (sea surface temperature) & SLA (sea level anomaly) fields, an extension of analog data assimilation framework (https://github.com/ptandeo/AnDA) to high-dimensional satellite-derived geophysical fields.
